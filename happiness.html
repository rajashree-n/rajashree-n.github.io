Few things are priceless...
</p>

<p>
Well my semester 6 results were out yesterday. The day started with getting up late for college, even though i knew that i had to go early for the lecture since it was my first day to college. Somehow i managed to get ready on time and at the same time got whatsapp from a friend that results are displayed. So, I started panicking I mean like it wasn't expected that results would be declared so early. So, without even thinking about anything is switched off my net. haha.. because i didn't wanted to get tensed till I reach my college. And soon I reached my college.. I went on to the list searching for "Naik" and yes here it is, then searched horizontally. Umm.. Here it is "PASS" with 9.33 cgpa. Woah! that wasn't expected. This would the second happiest day! haha.. second because first I was happy when I got more cgpa then this(hmm not trying to flaunt :p). Anyways, some of my friend didn't come to college so had to see theirs too. Each one of them did very well and had passed with excellent cgpa. In all these results tension as well as happiness I started receiving some different messages. This was something different I had ever experienced. Few of my friends whom I had helped during exam were messaging me saying "thank you" and they they never did expect that they could i did it. I mean this feeling of happiness was something else. Even though there were many who scored more than me but I guess the being involve in someone part of happiness that feeling is priceless. Its like you have already on the top.</p>
<p>It wasn't just me just the person themselves have work hard so they have got their dream come true, but being able to help them to achieve it gave me real happiness and made me feel proud.</p>
<p>This world needs your love, kindness and positivity! Stay Positive!
