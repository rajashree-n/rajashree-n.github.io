<p>
sometimes i wonder that we just cry over stupid thing, over stupid reasons. Why not live life as if there are no problems! .. thats not possible but still.</p>
<p>Why not go for a coffee with our ownself. why not keep calm and do our own work ignoring everything, Why not give a blank answer to someone in a quarrel when you already know that you don’t care who wins.. silence is my sword!:p This is my way to handle life. This world is selfish so I’m.. lol yes! Why not? but my thoughts changed suddenly..</p>
<p>Yesterday when i was getting late for my college and somehow managed to get an auto and reached the station, but i didn’t had change to pay the fare. So instead of 8rs, i gave him 5rs as i was getting late didn’t want to argue with the him even he didn’t do it haha.. Luckily.</p>
<p>While i was giving the the money a small poor boy came towards me and started pulling my bag and was saying, “Didi didi paisa do na.. didi”, I was running to catch my train still the boy was following me. So i remember that i had 2rs in my bag somewhere, at that time i didn’t care about the train not even  the lecture, i started searching for money. Soon another guy just like this poor fellow came towards me and started asking for money. I ignored him, as I was irritated about getting late already.</p>
<p>Then when i got the money I handed over that 2rs to poor fellow, he and his friend started running and dancing in happiness. At that time I felt like so happy that i made someone smile and that thing made my day! I think we should always be contend with what we have in our life, always stay statisfied with what you have. But should have that kind of thirst and want to learn new things but always be contented with life. Life will be much better.</p>
<p>
 Its a good story which will always be remembered.
</p>
<p>Spend a day once.. just switch from everything and observe the world! :) </p>
